            <p>Remember that unlocked abilities must be activated. In the beginning, the number of skills slots is strictly limited. You shouldn't add new ones if Geralt won't be able to use them. It is a good idea to invest in the strength of two basic attacks - they make your life easier.</p>

            <p>Plan your character development carefully. Unlocking the strongest skills costs many points so most of them won't be available for you for a long time.</p>

            <p>It is wise to support whole skills group with mutagens. Kill many monsters, for example drowners, they will give you mutagens at the beginning of the game. Remember about correctly selecting colors to increase the effect.</p>

            <p>Brew basic potions as quickly as possible, especially the Swallow. As long as you have Alcohest in your equipment, your potions supply will replenish automatically each time you meditate. Alcohest is easily available, you can gather lots of it by looting chests.</p>
