					<td><b>Geralt of Rivia</b></td>
					<td>Also known as the White Wolf, Geralt is the orphaned son of a sorceress, a rare oddity considering sorceresses are said to be infertile. Geralt's life has been marked by destiny, manifested in many chance encounters that have dragged this Witcher into larger-than-life events. His fate is bound to that of the sorceress Yennefer, thanks to his last-ditch attempt at saving her life. Despite his rough exterior and hard demeanor, this antihero is a big softy with a huge heart.</td>

					<td><b>Ciri</b></td>
					<td>Also called the Lion Cub of Cintra, Cirilla is Geralt's adopted daughter. She was claimed before birth by the Witcher after he invoked the Law of Surprise, a ritual whereby an unborn child is sometimes claimed by a Witcher as a reward for services rendered. Geralt never truly intended on taking her away from her parents, but destiny saw to it that little Ciri ended up in his care anyway, after her parents left her with her grandmother, Queen Calanthe of Cintra, who was subsequently killed by Nilfgaardian soldiers. Having been raised by Witchers and educated by the sorceress Yennefer, Ciri wished only to become a Witcher and set out on her own path.</td>

					<td><b>Yennefer</b></td>
					<td>Ciri's adoptive mother and Geralt's long time lover, Yennefer of Vengerberg is a powerful and ambitious sorceress. She has been instrumental in helping Ciri control and channel the immense power of the child's Elder Blood. Her fate is bound to that of Geralt due to an event known as the Last Wish. This magical bond formed the basis of their love for one another, but it could be argued that destiny brought them together regardless of the magical component. </td>

					<td><b>Emperor Emhyr var Emreis</b></td>
					<td>The Emperor of Nilfgaard, with the epithet "The White Flame Dancing Upon the Graves of His Foes", is Ciri's real father. After Geralt freed him of a curse, he promised his child to the Witcher's care in compliance with the Law of Surprise, payment a Witcher may demand in lieu of coin. Geralt never truly cared to uphold this debt and did not intend to take Ciri away from her parents, but destiny saw to it that she ended up in his care anyway. The Emperor now resents the Witcher and barely tolerates his presence. Emphyr does not have a good relationship with his daughter.</td>

					<td><b>Triss Merigold</b></td>
					<td>A relatively young sorceress and "big sister" to Ciri, Triss has been a part of both Geralt and Yen's lives for many years. She has also been romantically involved with Geralt in the past.</td>
